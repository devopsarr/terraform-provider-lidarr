}
```

### Optional

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API key for Lidarr authentication. Can be specified via the `LIDARR_API_KEY` environment variable.
- `extra_headers` (Attributes Set) Extra headers to be sent along with all Lidarr requests. If this attribute is unset, it can be specified via environment variables following this pattern `LIDARR_EXTRA_HEADER_${Header-Name}=${Header-Value}`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--extra_headers))
